              Wuthering Heights is an 1847 novel by Emily Brontë, initially published under her pen name Ellis Bell. It
              concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the
              Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with the Earnshaws' foster son, Heathcliff. The novel was
              influenced by Romanticism
              and Gothic fiction.

            </p>
            <p class="card"> Wuthering Heights is now widely considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written in
              English, but
              contemporaneous reviews were polarised. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical
              cruelty,
              including domestic abuse, and for its challenges to Victorian morality and religious and societal values.

              <p>Wuthering Heights was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Brontë's Agnes Grey before the
                success of
                their sister Charlotte's novel Jane Eyre, but they were published later. After Emily's death, Charlotte
                edited a
                second edition of Wuthering Heights, which was published in 1850. It has inspired an array of
                adaptations
                across
                several media, including English singer-songwriter Kate Bush's song of the same name.</p>

              First introduced to the reader after her death, through Lockwood's discovery of her
              diary and carvings. The description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume. She seems
              unsure whether she is, or wants to become, more like Heathcliff, or aspires to be more like Edgar. Some
              critics have argued that her decision to marry Edgar Linton is allegorically a rejection of nature and a
              surrender to culture, a choice with unfortunate, fateful consequences for all the other characters. She
              dies
              hours after giving birth to her daughter.

                Heathcliff
              </h3>
            </div>
            <p class="card"> Heathcliff is a foundling from Liverpool, who is taken by Mr. Earnshaw to Wuthering
              Heights,
              where he is
              reluctantly
              cared for by the family and spoiled by his adopted father. He and Mr. Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine, grow
              close,
              and
              their love is the central theme of the first volume. His revenge against the man she chooses to marry and
              its
              consequences are the central theme of the second volume. Heathcliff has been considered a Byronic hero,
              but
              critics
              have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points, making his character hard to fit into any
              single
              type.
              He has an ambiguous position in society, and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that
              "Heathcliff"
              is
              both
              his given name and his surname. The character of Heathcliff may have been inspired by Branwell Brontë. An
              alcoholic
              and an opium addict, he would have indeed terrorised Emily and her sister Charlotte during frequent crises
              of
              delirium
              tremens that affected him a few years before his death. Even though Heathcliff has no alcohol or drug
              problems,
              the
              influence of Branwell's character is likely; although the same could be said, perhaps more appropriately,
              of
              Hindley
              Earnshaw and Linton Heathcliff.</p>

              Catherine marries him instead of Heathcliff because of his higher social status, with disastrous results

              well-read,
              and she also experiences the more genteel manners of Thrushcross Grange. She is referred to as Ellen, her
              given

              to show respect, and as Nelly among those close to her. Critics have discussed how far her actions as an

              because
              Hindley has mortgaged it to Heathcliff). Heathcliff, in contrast, teaches him vulgarities as a way of
              avenging
              himself
              on Hindley. Hareton speaks with an accent similar to Joseph's, and occupies a position similar to that of
              a
              servant at
              Wuthering Heights, unaware that he has been done out of his inheritance. He can only read his name. In

                In 1801, Mr. Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire, pays a visit to his landlord,
                Heathcliff, at
                his remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There he meets a reserved young woman (later
                identified
                as
                Cathy
                Linton), Joseph, a cantankerous servant, and Hareton, an uneducated fellow, who presents himself as
                such.
                Everyone
                is
                sullen and inhospitable. Snowed in for the night, Lockwood reads the diary of the former inhabitant of
                his
                room,
                Catherine Earnshaw, and has a nightmare in which a ghostly Catherine begs to enter through the window.
                Awakened by
                Lockwood's fearful yells, Heathcliff is troubled.
                Lockwood later returns to Thrushcross Grange in heavy snow, falls ill from the cold and becomes
                bedridden.
                While
                he
                recovers, Lockwood's housekeeper Ellen "Nelly" Dean tells him the story of the strange family.

              Thirty years earlier, the Earnshaws live at Wuthering Heights with their children, Hindley and Catherine,
              and a
              servant—Nelly herself. Returning from a trip to Liverpool, Earnshaw brings home a young orphan whom he
              names
              Heathcliff; Earnshaw treats the boy as his favourite. His own children he neglects, especially after his
              wife
              dies.
              Hindley beats Heathcliff, who gradually becomes close friends with Catherine.
              Hindley departs for university, returning as the new master of Wuthering Heights on the death of his
              father
              three
              years later. He and his new wife Frances allow Heathcliff to stay, but only as a servant.


              The climb to ruined farmhouse Top Withens, thought to have inspired the Earnshaws' home in Wuthering
              Heights
              Heathcliff and Catherine spy on Edgar Linton and his sister Isabella, children who live nearby at
              Thrushcross
              Grange.
              Catherine is attacked by their dog, and the Lintons take her in, sending Heathcliff home. When the Lintons
              visit,
              Hindley and Edgar make fun of Heathcliff; a fight ensues. Heathcliff is locked in the attic and vows
              revenge.
              Frances dies after giving birth to a son, Hareton. Two years later, Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar.
              She
              confesses
              to Nelly that she loves Heathcliff, and will try to help but cannot marry him because of his low social
              status.
              Nelly
              warns her against the plan. Heathcliff overhears part of the conversation and, misunderstanding
              Catherine's
              heart,
              flees the household. Catherine falls ill, distraught.

              Three years after his departure, with Edgar and Catherine having married in the
              meantime,
              Heathcliff
              unexpectedly
              returns, now a wealthy gentleman. He encourages Isabella's infatuation with him as a means of revenge on
              Catherine.
              Enraged by Heathcliff's constant presence at Thrushcross Grange, Edgar cuts off contact. Catherine
              responds
              by
              locking
              herself in her room and refusing food; pregnant with Edgar's child, she never fully recovers. At
              Wuthering
              Heights,
              Heathcliff gambles with Hindley, who mortgages the property to him to pay his debts. Heathcliff elopes
              with
              Isabella,
              but the relationship fails and they soon return.
              When Heathcliff discovers that Catherine is dying, he visits her in secret. She dies shortly after
              giving
              birth to
              a
              daughter, Cathy, and Heathcliff rages, calling on her ghost to haunt him for as long as he lives.
              Isabella
              flees
              south
              where she gives birth to Heathcliff's son, Linton. Hindley dies six months later, leaving Heathcliff as
              master of
              Wuthering Heights.
              Twelve years later, after Isabella's death, the still-sickly Linton is brought back to live with his
              uncle
              Edgar
              at
              the Grange, but Heathcliff insists that his son must instead live with him. Cathy and Linton
              (respectively
              at the
              Grange and Wuthering Heights) gradually develop a relationship. Heathcliff schemes to ensure that they
              marry, and
              on
              Edgar's death demands that the couple move in with him. He becomes increasingly wild and reveals that on
              the
              night
              Catherine died he dug up her grave, and ever since has been plagued by her ghost. When Linton dies,
              Cathy
              has no
              option but to remain at Wuthering Heights.
              Having reached the present day, Nelly's tale concludes.</p>

              Lockwood grows tired of the moors and moves away. Eight months later he arrives at Wuthering Heights
              while
              travelling
              through the area. He sees Nelly again, who is now the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights. She reports that
              Cathy
              has
              been teaching the still-uneducated Hareton to read. Heathcliff was seeing visions of the dead Catherine;
              he
              avoided
              the young people, saying that he could not bear to see Catherine's eyes, which they both shared, looking
              at
              him.

              He
              had stopped eating, and some days later was found dead in Catherine's old room.
              In the present, Lockwood learns that Cathy and Hareton plan to marry and move to the Grange. Joseph is
              left
              to
              take
              care of the declining Wuthering Heights. Nelly says that the locals have seen the ghosts of Catherine
              and
              Heathcliff
              wandering abroad together. Lockwood passes by the graves of Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff, and is
              convinced
              they
              are finally at peace.

                In 1850 Charlotte Brontë edited the original text for the second edition of Wuthering Heights and also
                provided it
                with her foreword. She addressed the faulty punctuation and orthography but also diluted Joseph's thick
                Yorkshire
                dialect. Writing to her publisher, W. S. Williams, she said that
                It seems to me advisable to modify the orthography of the old servant Joseph's speeches; for though, as
                it
                stands,
                it
                exactly renders the Yorkshire dialect to a Yorkshire ear, yet I am sure Southerns must find it
                unintelligible; and
                thus, one of the most graphic characters in the book is lost on them.

                The original text as published by Thomas Cautley Newby in 1847 is available online in two parts. The
                novel
                was
                first
                published together with Anne Brontë's Agnes Grey in a three-volume format: Wuthering Heights filled the
                first two
                volumes and Agnes Grey made up the third.
